# Spotify API Credentials
# Get these from the Spotify Developer Dashboard: https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/
# Ensure your redirect URI in Spotify Developer Dashboard is set to http://localhost:9002/api/auth/callback/spotify if using NextAuth.js (not currently used in this template but good practice for Spotify apps)
# For this template, only Client ID and Secret are used for server-to-server requests.
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET

# Google AI / Genkit (for Gemini)
# Genkit typically uses Application Default Credentials (ADC) when running locally.
# To set this up:
# 1. Install the Google Cloud CLI: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install
# 2. Log in with your Google account: `gcloud auth login`
# 3. Set up Application Default Credentials: `gcloud auth application-default login`
# Ensure your Google Cloud project has the "Vertex AI API" enabled and
# the authenticated user/service account has the "Vertex AI User" role.
#
# In deployed environments (like Firebase App Hosting or Google Cloud Run),
# the necessary credentials/permissions are usually configured for the runtime service account automatically.
# If you need to use a specific service account key JSON file locally (less common for Genkit with Gemini),
# you could set the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable:
# GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/your/service-account-key.json
# However, ADC is the recommended local development approach.
