# For Genkit/Gemini with Google AI:
# Genkit will typically use Application Default Credentials (ADC) when running locally
# after you've run `gcloud auth application-default login`.
# This is the recommended approach for local development and many cloud environments.
# Make sure your Google Cloud project has the "Vertex AI API" enabled.
#
# If you prefer or need to use an API key directly (e.g., for specific client-side scenarios,
# or environments where ADC is not feasible, though less recommended for server-side applications due to security),
# you can set the GOOGLE_API_KEY environment variable. The Google AI plugin for Genkit may pick this up.
